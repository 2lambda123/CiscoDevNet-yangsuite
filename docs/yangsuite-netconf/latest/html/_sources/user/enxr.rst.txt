Setting Device to ENXR
======================

ENXR is a device simulator based on an XR image and it is used for development.
After building the ENXR image, the XR simulator is brought up running in a
process on the Cisco ADS server.  Another process is then started and NETCONF
commands are sent through POSIX pipes.

**You must install YANG Suite in the ENXR workspace.**

**Be sure to allow remote access to run from laptop browser.**

For a full guide on how to build and operate the ENXR simulator, go to the
internal Cisco Employee Connection web site and search on "ENXR".

Starting YANG Suite in an ENXR
------------------------------
After YANG Suite is installed in the ENXR workspace, bring up the XR instance
in a terminal window, the XR connector instance in another terminal window, and
start YANG Suite in the XR connector terminal using the full path to the
start.sh script.

XR instance terminal:
::

  cd /nobackup/joego/enxr1
  lboot -m

XR connector terminal with YANG Suite installed in /nobackup/joego/enxr1/ysuite:
::

  cd /nobackup/joego/enxr1
  lboot -mc
  /nobackup/joego/enxr1/ysuite/yangsuite/start.sh

Assuming you installed YANG Suite allowing remote access, run YANG Suite from
your laptop browser pointing the URL to your Cisco ADS install.

With the latest NETCONF plugin, you will find a new device variant named
"Cisco IOS XR (ENXR)". Since you will be communicating through pipes and the
username is not enforced, the only required setting is the
"Device Supports NETCONF" checkbox and the NETCONF "Device Variant" set to
"Cisco IOS XR (ENXR)". YANG Suite will operate on the ENXR device just as it
would with any other device.

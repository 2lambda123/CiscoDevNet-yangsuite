How to access the registration page ?
#####################################

* visit /accounts/register/ directly

2 step registration with email activation
#########################################
This feature uses the 2-step email activation form of registration of django-registration. Detailed workflow of that can be found here : https://django-registration.readthedocs.io/en/3.0/activation-workflow.html

Email for registration
######################
The default form of django-registration allows the user to separately configure the username and provide any email to register with. For the corporate setting we need a way to configure the email to a fixed domain for registration so that the user just enters their userid as the username and an activation email would be sent to the fixed email. This domain can controlled using the setting:
REGISTRATION_EMAIL_DOMAIN = <string> (ex 'cisco.com')

Ex: So for a username 'marvinds' the email for activation would be sent to marvinds@cisco.com

If the REGISTRATION_EMAIL_DOMAIN setting is not provided, the default django-registration behavior takes over and a user can configure the registration email address.

The UI form email field is marked required or not visible at all depending on the REGISTRATION_EMAIL_DOMAIN setting being ignore or set respectively.

Available settings
